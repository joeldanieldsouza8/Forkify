Publisher-Subscriber Pattern Overview:

The pub-sub pattern is a design pattern used in software development to establish communication between different parts of an application. 
It allows one part of the code (the publisher) to notify multiple other parts (subscribers) about events or changes without them needing to know each other directly. 
This pattern promotes loose coupling between components.

Examples and Analogies:

Real-Life Analogy: Newspaper Subscription

1.  Imagine you subscribe to a newspaper (the publisher) for daily updates. You receive the newspaper at your doorstep every morning. You don't need to go to the newspaper's office to get the news; the newspaper is delivered to you automatically. In this analogy:

    You are a subscriber.
    The newspaper is the publisher.
    The act of delivering the newspaper to your doorstep is the event.

    The publisher (newspaper) notifies you (subscriber) about the event (newspaper delivery) without you actively checking for updates.

2.  JavaScript Newspaper Example

    - The button is the publisher.
    - The click and mouseover events are events.
    - The event listeners are subscribers.

    When the button is clicked or hovered over, it triggers the associated events, and the event listeners (subscribers) respond to those events without the button needing to know about the listeners.

    // Publisher (Button)
    const button = document.querySelector('#myButton');

    // Subscribers (Event Listeners)
    button.addEventListener('click', function () {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    });

    button.addEventListener('mouseover', function () {
    console.log('Mouse over button!');
    });

    // Publisher triggers the event
    button.click(); // Simulate a button click



Forkify JavaScript Code: Controller and View

In your code, the controller.js file is responsible for controlling the application's flow, and the recipeView.js file is responsible for rendering data to the DOM. To apply the pub-sub pattern:

    The controller.js file acts as the subscriber, waiting for specific events (hashchange and load).
    The recipeView.js file acts as the publisher, emitting these events when certain conditions are met.

For example, when the URL hash changes or the page loads, the recipeView.js file emits the hashchange and load events. The controller.js file subscribes to these events using the addHandlerRender() method, and when these events occur, it triggers the controlRecipes() function.

    recipeView.js: Publisher (emits events)
    controller.js: Subscriber (listens for events)

This separation of concerns allows the view (recipeView.js) to notify the controller (controller.js) about important changes (e.g., URL hash change or page load) without these components needing to know each other directly.
